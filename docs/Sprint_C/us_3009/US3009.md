- *3.1 Functional Requirements*
    - FRB07 - View Board History A user views a history of updates in a board
    - NFR13 - Design and Implement Shared Board Synchronization This functional
      part of the system has very specific technical requirements, particularly some concerns
      about synchronization problems. In fact, several clients will try to concurrently update
      boards. As such, the solution design and implementation must be based on threads,
      condition variables and mutexes. Specific requirements will be provided in SCOMP.

- *3.2 Documentation excerpts*
    - "The system should maintain an history/log of all the updates in the board"
  
**4.Interested actors**
