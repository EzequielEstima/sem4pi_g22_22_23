### 4.3. Tests

**Test 1:** *Verifies that the response status is correct after update*
```
public void ensureStatusChangesToAccepted() {
	Invitation instance = invFac.build(...);
	instance.updateResponseStatus(ResponseStatusValue.ACCEPTED);
	ResponseStatusValue expected = new ResponseStatusValue(2);
	ResponseStatusValue result = instace.currentStatus();   
}
```
```
public void ensureStatusChangesToRejected() {
	Invitation instance = invFac.build(...);
	instance.updateResponseStatus(ResponseStatusValue.REJECTED);
	ResponseStatusValue expected = new ResponseStatusValue(3);
	ResponseStatusValue result = instace.currentStatus();   
}
```
