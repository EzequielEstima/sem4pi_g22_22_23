# US 1004 - As Manager, I want to open and close courses

## 1. Context

It is the first time the task is assigned to be developed.
This US will allow us to change the status of the courses to open or closed.

## 2. Requirements

The flow of the status of course needs to follow this sequence :
event create (-> state close) -> event open (->state open) -> event open enrollments (-> state
enroll) -> event close enrollments (-> state in progress) -> event close (-> state closed)

**Main actor**

* Manager

**Interested actors (and why)**

* Manager: wants to open/close courses

**Preconditions**

* There needs to be at least one course in the system
* The status of the course needs to be closed or enrollments closed

**Postconditions**

* The status of the course needs to be persisted in the system

**Main scenario**
1. Manager asks to change the status of a course to open/closed
2. System shows all courses that can be opened/closed with its current state
3. Manger picks a course
4. System shows its state
5. Manager chooses state
6. System asks for confirmation
7. Manger confirms
8. System persists the new status of course and informs to Manager that the operation was completed with success

**Other scenarios**

**a.** The system doesn't have any possible courses that can be opened/closed
1. Manager asks to change the status of a course to open/closed
2. System informs that there are no courses available to open or close

**b.** The Manager doesn't confirm the operation
1. Manager asks to change the status of a course to open/closed
2. System shows all courses that can be opened/closed with its current state
3. Manger picks course
4. System shows its state
5. Manager chooses state
6. System asks for confirmation
7. Manager doesn't confirm
8. System informs that the operation was aborted

        assertTrue(course.changeStatus("OPEN"));
    }
```


## 5. Implementation
Here are some samples of the implementation:
1. Method listOpenableClosableCourses() from OpenCloseCourseService
```
    public List<CourseDTOWithIdTitleStatus> listOpenableClosableCourses(){
        List<Course> courseList = courseRepository.listOpenableClosableCourses();
        List<CourseDTOWithIdTitleStatus> courseDTOList = new ArrayList<>();
        for(Course course : courseList) {
            courseDTOList.add(CourseMapper.toDTOWithIdTitleStatus(course));
        }
        return courseDTOList;
    }
````
2. Methods changeCourseStatus() from OpenCloseCourseService
```
    public void changeCourseStatus(CourseDTOWithIdTitleStatus courseDTO, String newStatus){
        Course course = courseRepository.ofIdentity(new CourseIdentifier(courseDTO.courseIdentifier)).get();
        course.changeStatus(newStatus);
        courseRepository.save(course);
    }
```
A resume of the commits for the implementation :
- [US_1004][DTO] Development of StatusCourseDTO
- [US_1004][Domain] Added methods changeStatus to Course and changed the enum in CourseStatus
- [US_1004][Persistence] Added the methods listOpenableClosable course in JPA and in memory
- [US_1004][Test] Added some tests to the methods changeStatus() of class Course
- [US_1004][Application] Implementation of the Service and the Controller
- [US_1004][Presentation] Created a UI to the US and added it to the course menu in the manager application

## 6. Observations

It is important to note that some parts of the code used in this implementation were developed by other team members :
- Domain classes and Repositories used - Creation of the classes made by Ezequiel Estima - 1211417 (Note : It is important to note that most methods used by me in the domain classes and repositories were created by me Marco Andrade - 1211469)
- Mapper and DTOBuilder - Creation of the classes and the methods within made by Diogo Araújo - 1200967
