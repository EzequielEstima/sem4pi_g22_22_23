# US 1010 - As Teacher, I want to create/update an exam


## 1. Context

It is the first time the task is assigned to be developed.
This User story will allow us to create exams/update in a course

## 2. Requirements

FRE01 - Create Exam A Teacher creates a new exam. This includes the specification
of the exam (i.e., its structure, in accordance with a grammar for exams that is used to
validate the specification of the exam)

â€¢ NFR09 - Exam Language The support for exams (its design, feedback and grading)
must follow specific technical requirements, specified in LPROG. The ANTLR tool should
be used (https://www.antlr.org/)


**Each exam specification must include a set of components or sections:**<br>
* Title - The title of the exam specification.<br>
*  Header - This component must include global settings, such as the type of feedback
(none, on-submission, after-closing) and the type of grade (none, on-submission, afterclosing). It may also contain a textual description to appear at the beginning of the
exam.<br>
* Sequence of Sections - After the header, the exam is composed of sequence of one or
more sections. Each section is a group of questions. Each section may contain a textual
description to appear at the beginning of the group of questions. The type of questions
that can be used in the sections is described next<br>

## 3. Analysis

This US can be divided in the two use cases one to create exam and other to update exam

### UC - Create Exam
**Main actor**
* Teacher

**Interested actors (and why)**
* Teacher : wants to create an exam

**Main scenario**
1. Teacher select option to create an exam
2. System shows list of courses the teacher teaches
3. Teacher selects a course 
4. System asks for the path to exam file, and the initial and final date 
5. Teacher inserts data 
6. System informs operation was a success

### UC - Update Exam 

**Main actor**
* Teacher

**Interested actors (and why)**

**Main scenario**
1. Teacher select option to update an exam
2. System shows list of exams the teacher created
3. Teacher select one exam
4. System what do you which to update, and for the specific information

## 5. Implementation

### 5.1 Create Exam

1. Method createExam() from CreateUpdateExamService
```

        examRepository.save(exam);
        courseRepository.save(course);

        return true;
    }
```
2. Method verifyExamSpecification() from VerifyExamSpecificationService
```

        }else{
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The specification of exam is incorrect");
        }
    }
```

### 5.1 Update Exam

1. Method updateExam() from CreateUpdateExamService
```
  public boolean updateExam(String structure, Date initialDate, Date finalDate, ExamDTOWithDatesExamTitleCourseId examDTO){

        }
        examRepository.save(exam);
        return true;
    }
```

2. Method listTeacherExam() from ListTeacherExamsService
```

        AuthorizationService authz = AuthzRegistry.authorizationService();
        SystemUser systemUser = authz.session().get().authenticatedUser();
