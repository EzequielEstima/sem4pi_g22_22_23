# US 1002 - As Manager, I want to create courses


## 1. Context

It is the first time the task is assigned to be developed.
This User story will allow us to create courses which will let us do many other US's as a lot of them are related to courses.

## 2. Requirements

**Main actor**

* Manager

**Interested actors (and why)**

* Manager : wants to create, change status, bulk enroll students, set teachers of a specific course
* Student : wants to request enrollment in a course
* Teacher : wants to schedule classes/extra-classes and create exams for a specific course 

**Pre conditions**

* N/A

**Post conditions**

* The created course should be registered and persisted in the system

**Main scenario**
1. Manager selects option to create a course
2. System asks for the course creation data (name, title, description, identifier and enrollment limits)
3. Manager inserts the data
4. System ask for confirmation
5. Manager confirms
6. System informs operation success


**Other scenarios**

**5.a.** The system verifies that a course with the inserted identifier already exists in the system  
1. The system notifies that this problem has occurred
2. The use case terminates

**5.b.** Manager doesnÂ´t confirm
1. The use case terminates

**Special requirements**

### 4.4. Tests

**Test 1:** *Verifies that it is not possible to create an instance of the Course class with null values.*

```
@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
	Course instance = new Course(null, null, null, null, null);
}
```

**Test 2:** *Verifies that it is not possible to create an instance of the EnrollmentLimits class with minLimit as a negative value.*
```
@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
public void ensureNegativeLimitIsNotAllowed() {
	EnrollmentLimits instance = new EnrollmentLimits(-1,10);
}
```

**Test 3:** *Verifies that it is not possible to create an instance of the EnrollmentLimits class with minLimit as 0.*
```
@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
public void ensureZeroLimitNullIsNotAllowed() {
	EnrollmentLimits instance = new EnrollmentLimits(0,10);
}
```

**Test 4:** *Verifies that it is not possible to create an instance of the EnrollmentLimits class with maxLimit less than minLimit.*
```
@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
public void ensureMaxLimitGreaterOrEqualThanMinLimit() {
	EnrollmentLimits instance = new EnrollmentLimits(10,9);
}
```
**Test 5:** *Verifies that, right after creation, courseStatus is set as closed*
```
@Test
public void ensureCourseStatusIsClosed() {
	CourseFactory fac = new CourseFactory()
	Course instance = fac.buildCourse(...);
	assertTrue(instance.isClosed());
}
```

**Test 6:** *Verifies that, right after creation, there is no teacher in charge associated*
```
@Test
public void ensureNoTeacherInCharge() {
    CourseFactory fac = new CourseFactory()
	Course instance = fac.buildCourse(...);
	assertFalse(instance.hasTeacherInCharge());
}
```

## 5. Implementation
Here are some samples of the implementation:

1. Method buildCourse() from CourseFactory
```
    public Course buildCourse(String courseId, String courseTitle, String courseName, String description, int maxEnrollments, int minEnrollments){
        CourseIdentifier id = new CourseIdentifier(courseId);
        CourseTitle title = new CourseTitle(courseTitle);
        CourseName name = new CourseName(courseName);
        Description desc = new Description(description);
        EnrollmentLimits limits = new EnrollmentLimits(minEnrollments,maxEnrollments);
        CourseStatus status = new CourseStatus("CLOSE");

        return new Course(id,title,name,desc,limits,status,null);
    }
```
