=======================================

# 1. Context #
**US1003**: In this US the status of a given course will be updated to either state enroll or state in progress, that is relevant to **US1006** and **US1008**.

# 2. Requirements #
**1. Acceptance Criteria**

- The course must be created.
- The previous course status versus the new one must be valid in terms of the life cycle flow.

**3.Main scenario**
1. Manager selects the option to open and close enrollments in courses.
2. System shows the available courses.
3. Manager selects the course where he wants to change the status.
4. System requests if he wants to open or close enrollments in the selected course.
5. Manager chooses an option.

# 5. Tests

**Test 1:** *Verifies that we can change the course status from OpenEnrollments to ClosedEnrollments*
```
    @Test
    public void ensureThatCourseStatusCanChangeFromOpenEnrollmentsToClosedEnrollments(){
        Assert.assertTrue(COURSE_OPEN_ENROLLMENTS.changeStatus(CLOSED_ENROLLMENTS_STATUS));
    }
```

**Test 2:** *Verifies that we can change the course status from ClosedEnrollments to Closed*

```
@Test
    public void ensureThatCourseStatusCanChangeFromClosedEnrollmentsToClosed(){
        Assert.assertTrue(COURSE_CLOSED_ENROLLMENTS.changeStatus(CLOSED_STATUS));
    }
```
**Test 3:** *Verifies that we can't change the course status from OpenEnrollments to Open*

```
@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
    public void ensureThatCourseStatusCannotChangeFromOpenEnrollmentsToOpen(){
        COURSE_OPEN_ENROLLMENTS.changeStatus(OPEN_STATUS);
    }
```

**Test 4:** *Verifies that we can't change the course status from ClosedEnrollments to OpenEnrollments*

```
@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
    public void ensureThatCourseStatusCannotChangeFromClosedEnrollmentsToOpenEnrollments(){
        COURSE_CLOSED_ENROLLMENTS.changeStatus(OPEN_ENROLLMENTS_STATUS);
    }
```
