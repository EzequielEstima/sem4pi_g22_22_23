# US3001 - As Project Manager, I want the team to prepare the communication infrastruture for the Shared Boards and the depoyment of the solution

## 1. Context

It is the first time the task is assigned to be developed.
In this US we were requested to prepare a basic communication between a shared board app and a shared board server

## 2. Requirements

- Is TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) based, therefore, prior to any actual data exchange, a
  TCP connection must be established.
- Uses the client-server model. The client application (Shared Board App) is the one that takes
  the initiative of requesting a TCP connection establishment with the counterpart server
  application (Shared Board Server), which should accept incoming connection requests.
- Once the TCP connection is established, the client-server is no longer mandatory, both the client
  application and the server application are allowed to take the initiative of sending data, a request.
  The counterpart application must be always available to receive a request, process it, and then
  send a response to the received request.
-  Every request (sent by the client or the server) has a mandatory response (correspondingly sent
  by the server or the client), both requests and responses share a same general message format
  described ahead.
- Once established, the TCP connection between the client and the server is kept alive and is used
  for all required data exchanges while the client application is running.
## 3. Analysis
- Following the application protocol file that was provided to us we can conclude that we need to follow this:

Both these fields are to be interpreted as unsigned integer numbers (0 to255).

## 4. Design

* To crete this user story we need to create two applications:
- Shared Board Client
- Shared Board Server
To received and send messages between these two applications we need to use sockets, buffers and they need to follow the protocols that were mentioned above.
