### Client Question
#### Question
Good morning,
Relative to this US, "As User, I want to list all the courses that are available to me" what should we list according to the User role?<br>
Student: Courses that Student is enrolled <br>
Teacher: Courses that Teacher teaches <br>
Manager: All Courses

Are these assumptions right?

Thank you
Group 2


#### Answer
Hello Jos√©. <br>
Regarding Teachers and Managers I agree with you. <br>
Regarding students I think it is best to list all the courses in which the student is enrolled or may be enrolled (the enrolments are opened). If not, how would a student know the courses in which he/she can enrol? <br>
Regards.

### 4.3. Tests

Test 1: Verifies that CourseDTOWithIdTitle has the correct format

```
 @Test
    public void ensureThatCourseDTOWithIdTitleHasTheCorrectFormat() {
        Course course = new Course(new CourseIdentifier("Id1"), new CourseTitle("Title1"), new CourseName("Name1"), new Description("Desciption1"), new EnrollmentLimits(1, 5), new CourseStatus(CourseStatusValue.CLOSE), new Teacher());
        CourseDTOWithIdTitle test = CourseMapper.toDTOWithIdTitle(course);
        assertEquals(test.toString(), "Title1 - Id1");
    }
}
```


## 5. Implementation

1. Method listCourse() from ListCourseService
```
public ArrayList<CourseDTOWithIdTitle> listCourse(){

        AuthorizationService authz = AuthzRegistry.authorizationService();
        SystemUser user = authz.session().get().authenticatedUser();
        CourseRepository courseRepository = PersistenceContext.repositories().courseRepository();
        Iterable<Course> listCourse;
        if (user.hasAny(BaseRoles.MANAGER)){
            listCourse = courseRepository.findAll();
        }else{
            if (user.hasAny(BaseRoles.TEACHER)){
                listCourse = courseRepository.findTeacherCourses(user);
            }else{
                listCourse = courseRepository.findStudentCourses(user);
            }
        }
        ArrayList<CourseDTOWithIdTitle> listCourseDto = new ArrayList<>();
        if (listCourse != null) {
            for (Course course : listCourse) {
                listCourseDto.add(CourseMapper.toDTOWithIdTitle(course));
            }
        }

        return listCourseDto;
    }
```

2. Method findTeacherCourses() from CourseRepository
```
public List<Course> findTeacherCourses(SystemUser systemUser) {
        TypedQuery<Course> query = createQuery(
                "SELECT DISTINCT c FROM Course c JOIN c.teacherInCharge t JOIN Person p ON p.teacher = c.teacherInCharge WHERE p.systemUser = :systemUser AND c.courseStatus.courseStatusValue <> 'CLOSED' " +
                        "OR (:systemUser IN (SELECT p.systemUser FROM c.teachersList t JOIN Person p ON t = p.teacher where c.courseStatus.courseStatusValue <> 'CLOSED'))",
                Course.class);
        query.setParameter("systemUser", systemUser);
        return query.getResultList();
    }
```

3. Method findStudentCourses() from CourseRepository
```
public List<Course> findStudentCourses(SystemUser systemUser) {
        TypedQuery<Course> query = createQuery(
                "SELECT DISTINCT c FROM Course c "
                        + "WHERE (c.courseStatus.courseStatusValue = 'OPEN_ENROLLMENTS' AND NOT (:systemUser IN (SELECT p.systemUser FROM c.enrollmentsList e JOIN Person p ON p.student = e.student "
                        + "Where (e.enrollmentStatus.enrollmentStatusValue = 'REJECTED')))) "
                        + "OR (:systemUser IN (SELECT p.systemUser FROM c.enrollmentsList e JOIN Person p ON p.student = e.student "
                        + "Where ((e.enrollmentStatus.enrollmentStatusValue = 'ACCEPTED' OR e.enrollmentStatus.enrollmentStatusValue = 'PENDING') AND c.courseStatus.courseStatusValue <> 'CLOSED')))",
                Course.class);
        query.setParameter("systemUser", systemUser);
        return query.getResultList();
    }
```
