# US 1008 - As Student, I want to request my enrollment in a course


## 1. Context

It is the first time the task is assigned to be developed.
This User story will allow us to create enrollments that, after approved by a manager, will tell us if a student is participating in a specific course

## 2. Requirements

**Main actor**

* Student

**Interested actors (and why)**

* Manager : wants to approve/reject enrollments in Course
* Student : wants to request enrollment in a course

**Pre conditions**

* There must be a Course available for the student to request an enrollment (course in open enrollments)

**Post conditions**

* The created enrollment should be registered and persisted in the system

**Main scenario**
1. Student selects option to request an enrollment
2. System shows available courses and ask the student to select one
3. Student chooses one course
4. System ask for confirmation
5. Student confirms
6. System informs operation success


**Other scenarios**

**2.a.** The system verifies that there are no courses available  
1. The system notifies that this problem has occurred
2. The use case terminates

**5.b.** The system verifies that there already exists a requested enrollment for that student for that course 
1. The system notifies that this problem has occurred
2. The use case terminates

**5.b.** Student doesn't confirm
1. The use case terminates

**Special requirements**

### 4.3. Tests

**Test 1:** *Verifies that enrollmentId cannot be less or equal to 0*
```
@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
public void ensureEnrollmentStatusIsPending() {
	EnrollmentID instance = newEnrollmentId();
}
```

**Test 2:** *Verifies that, right after creation, enrollmentStatus is set as pending*
```
@Test
public void ensureEnrollmentStatusIsPending() {
	Enrollment instance = newEnrollment();
	assertTrue(instance.isPending());
}
```

**Test 3:** *Verifies that enrollment was added to enrollment list in Student*
```
@Test
public void ensureEnrollmentIsAddedToStudent() {
	Enrollment instance = newEnrollment();
	Student student = newStudent(...);
	student.addEnrollment(instance);
	assertTrue(student.hasEnrollment(instance));
}
```

**Test 4:** *Verifies that enrollment was added to enrollment list in Course*
```
@Test
public void ensureEnrollmentIsAddedToCourse() {
	Enrollment instance = newEnrollment();
	Course course = new  Course(...);
	course.addEnrollment(instance);
	assertTrue(course.hasEnrollment(instance));
}
```

## 5. Implementation

1. Method buildEnrollment() from EnrollmentFactory
```
public Enrollment buildEnrollment(Long enrollmentId, Course course, Student student){
        EnrollmentId id = new EnrollmentId(enrollmentId);
        EnrollmentStatus status = new EnrollmentStatus(EnrollmentStatusValue.PENDING);
        return new Enrollment(id,status,course,student);
    }
```


2. Method findEnrollmentByCourseIDAndMechNumber() from EnrollmentRepository
```
@Override
    public Optional<Enrollment> findEnrollmentByCourseIDAndMechNumber(CourseIdentifier courseId, MecanographicNumber mechNumber) {
        final Map<String, Object> params = new HashMap<>();
        params.put("courseIdentifier", courseId);
        params.put("mechNumber", mechNumber);
        return matchOne(" e.course.courseId =: courseIdentifier AND e.student.mecanographicNumber =: mechNumber",params);
    }
```

3. Method createEnrollment() from RequestEnrollmentService
```
public boolean createEnrollment(CourseDTOWithIdTitle courseDTO){
        EnrollmentRepository enrollmentRepo = PersistenceContext.repositories().enrollmentRepository();
        StudentRepository studentRepo = PersistenceContext.repositories().studentRepository();

        AuthorizationService authz = AuthzRegistry.authorizationService();
        SystemUser systemUser = authz.session().get().authenticatedUser();

        Student student = studentRepo.findStudentBySystemUser(systemUser);

        CourseIdentifier courseId = new CourseIdentifier(courseDTO.courseIdentifier);
        Course course = courseRepo.ofIdentity(courseId).get();

        if(enrollmentRepo.findEnrollmentByCourseIDAndMechNumber(courseId,student.identity()).isPresent()){
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Couldn't create enrollment. You already have requested an enrollment for this course");
        }

        long totalEnrollments = enrollmentRepo.count();

        Enrollment newEnrollment = new EnrollmentFactory().buildEnrollment(totalEnrollments+1,course,student);

        enrollmentRepo.save(newEnrollment);

        course.addEnrollment(newEnrollment);
        courseRepo.save(course);

        student.addEnrollment(newEnrollment);
        studentRepo.save(student);

        return true;
    }
```
