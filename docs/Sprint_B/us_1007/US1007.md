# 5. Tests

**Test 1:** *Ensure that the Enrollment created in Enroll In Bulk process is in state ACCEPTED*
```
@Test
    public void ensureEnrollmentStatusIsAcceptedInEnrollInBulk() {
        EnrollmentFactory fac = new EnrollmentFactory();
        Enrollment instance = fac.buildEnrollmentFromEnrollInBulk((long) 1,dummyCourse,dummyStudent);
        assertEquals("Accepted",instance.returnEnrollmentStatusString());
    }
```

**Test 2:** *Ensure that the data imported from the csv file is correct*

```
@Test
    void importCsvDataVerifyImportedData() {
        CsvReader csvReader = new CsvReader();
        List<String> actual = new ArrayList<>();
        csvReader.importCsvData(VALID_PATH, actual);
        List<String> expected = new ArrayList<>();
        expected.add("202300002");
        expected.add("202300001");
        expected.add("202300003");
        Assert.assertEquals(actual, expected);
    }
```
