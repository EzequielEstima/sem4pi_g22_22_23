# US G005 - As Project Manager, I want the team to configure the project structure to facilitate / accelerate the development of upcoming user stories.

## 1. Context

In this US a Relational Database will be created and consequently configured for our project

## 2. Requirements

1. The system must support that data persistence is done either "in memory" or in a relational database (RDB)
2. The system should have the ability to initialize some default data.
3. The solution must include a final deployment where a persistent relational database is used

## 3. Analysis

To perform this US, the following steps were followed:

1. Create and configure an H2 database with DEI Virtual Servers Private Cloud
2. Configure the persistence.xml in the project, adding the server url
3. Initialize the data in the database by running run_bootstrap.bat

## 4. Design

### 4.1. Realization

```
<property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.url" value="jdbc:h2:tcp://vsgate-s2.dei.isep.ipp.pt:10747/base;MV_STORE=FALSE;AUTO_SERVER=true;"/>
```

```
@Override
    public boolean execute() {
        registerManager("manager", TestDataConstants.PASSWORD1, "Jane", "Doe Admin",
                "jane.doe@email.local");
        return true;
    }
    
  private void registerManager(final String username, final String password, final String firstName,
                                 final String lastName, final String email) {
        final Set<Role> roles = new HashSet<>();
        roles.add(BaseRoles.MANAGER);

        registerUser(username, password, firstName, lastName, email, roles);
  }
```

## 6. Integration/Demonstration

In order to have access to the database in the program it is necessary to link the server url to persistence.xml
