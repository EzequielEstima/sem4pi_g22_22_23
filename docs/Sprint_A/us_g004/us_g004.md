# US G004 - As Project Manager, I want the team to add to the project the necessary scripts, so that build/executions/deployments/... can be executed effortlessly.
## 1. Context

This is an important requirement for our project so that we can build, execute and deploy our project.

## 2. Requirements

*US G004* As Project Manager, I Want the team to add the project's necessary scripts

- G004.1. The project needs to be buildable

- G004.2. The project needs to be executable
  
- G004.3. The project needs to be deployable


## 3. Analysis

For this US, first we will start with setting environment variables for the java jdk with version 11 or higher and the maven in version 3.6.1
After we will need to make our project buildable/executable/deployable utilizing scripts.

## 4. Design

### 4.1. Realization
To solve this problem the team utilized the files given by EAPLI and changed the version of Java's SNAPSHOT to 1.4.0.

### 4.2. Tests

While the project is being built some tests are done to verify if the dependency has been built successfully or not.

## 5. Implementation

### build-all.bat
```
	ECHO OFF
	ECHO make sure JAVA_HOME is set to JDK folder
	ECHO make sure maven is on the system PATH
	mvn %1 dependency:copy-dependencies package
```
### run-backoffice.bat
```
	REM set the class path,
	REM assumes the build was executed with maven copy-dependencies
	SET BASE_CP=base.app.backoffice.console\target\base.app.backoffice.console-1.4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar;base.app.backoffice.console\target\dependency\*;

	REM call the java VM, e.g, 
	java -cp %BASE_CP% eapli.base.app.backoffice.console.BaseBackoffice
```

## 6. Integration/Demonstration

To run these scripts it's needed in the working station to have the environment variables for the java jdk with version 11 or higher and the maven in version 3.6.1
